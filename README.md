TOMO
====

TOMO is a Touch Synthesizer board based on Arduino.

### What is TOMO?

##TO

**TO** means touch. Tomo uses **Swept Frequency Capacitive Sensing (SFCS)** a concept explored by [Disney Research Labs](http://www.disneyresearch.com/) on this [paper](http://www.disneyresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/touchechi2012.pdf). The Arduino implementation is based on the documentation by [ILLUTRON](http://illutron.dk/Instructable-Use-Any-Surface-as-a-Touch-Interface-with-Arduino) and developed by [Cleniem](https://github.com/clemniem). The ongoing research on SFCS can be found at fablabbcn/TouchE](https://github.com/fablabbcn/TouchE).

##MO

**MO** means [Mozzi](http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/) an amazing library for sound synthesis library for Arduino developed by [Tim Barrass](http://www.reverberant.com/pp/barrass.htm). This means you can create sounds with it from simple tones to delays and echos. We will soon add *.WAV palying functionality too.

### How is TOMO?

* Small
* Portable
* Easy
* Fun
* and it tuns on batteries for a week!
