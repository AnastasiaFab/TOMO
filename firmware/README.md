The TOMO code
=============

**TOMO** has two processors this means it runs two separate firmwares: one for touch and one for sound.

## Firmware

Check the **TO** folder for the Touch firmware and the **MO** folder for the Mozzi Sound firmware. The sound firmware is currently a boilerplate for you to create your new sounds. Check on the **mozzi tests** folder for more examples.

* Touch firmware: `TOMO_Touch_v05.ino`

* Sound firmware: `TOMO_Mozzi_v05.ino` 

### Dependencies

All firmware is based on the Arduino Core. For the Mozzi firmware it requires the [Mozzi library](sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/)
